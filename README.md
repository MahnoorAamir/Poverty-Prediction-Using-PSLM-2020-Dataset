# Poverty Prediction Using PSLM-2020 Dataset

This repository explores poverty estimation in Pakistan using the PSLM-2020 (Pakistan Social and Living Standards Measurement) dataset, aligning with the **World Bank's definition of poverty**. The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and training of machine learning models to predict poverty status at the individual level.

## üåç World Bank Definition of Poverty

According to the World Bank, poverty is defined as:
> *"The state of living on less than $2.15 per day (2017 PPP) or the inability to achieve a minimum standard of living, including access to basic needs such as education, health care, water, and housing."*

This definition guided the development of the target variable and the selection of relevant economic and social indicators from the PSLM-2020 dataset.

## üì¶ Dataset: PSLM-2020

The PSLM 2020 survey is a household-level dataset collected by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics. It includes information on:

- Education
- Health
- Housing conditions
- Asset ownership
- Household consumption
- Income sources
- Employment status

We used the instruction manual provided with the dataset to map questions to meaningful variables and preprocess the data accordingly.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Pipeline

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
- Extracted relevant household and individual-level files from PSLM-2020.
- Joined the datasets using appropriate keys (e.g., Household ID).
- Cleaned and imputed missing or inconsistent values.
- Mapped categorical variables to meaningful labels.
- Normalized and encoded variables for model input.

### 2. **Target Variable Creation**
- Constructed a binary poverty indicator:
  - `1` ‚Üí Individual is considered **poor** (below threshold based on consumption/income/assets).
  - `0` ‚Üí Individual is **non-poor**.
- Thresholds were based on national poverty lines, adjusted to World Bank standards.

### 3. **Feature Engineering**
- Derived socio-economic indicators including:
  - Education level
  - Employment status
  - Household size and dependency ratio
  - Access to water, sanitation, electricity
  - Asset ownership (TV, phone, vehicle, etc.)
  - Type and quality of housing

### 4. **Modeling**
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
